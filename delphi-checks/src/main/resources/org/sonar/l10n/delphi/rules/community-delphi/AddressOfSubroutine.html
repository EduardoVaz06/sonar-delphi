<p>
  Nested methods cannot be used as procedural values.
  <br />
  This will normally cause a compilation error, but such errors can be bypassed by using the address
  of the nested method with <code>@</code>.
  <br />
  In this scenario, the code generated by compiler will have undefined behavior.
