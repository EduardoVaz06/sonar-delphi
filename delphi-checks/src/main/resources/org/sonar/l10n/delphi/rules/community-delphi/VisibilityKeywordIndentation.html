<p>
  Visibility specifier directives (<code>private</code>,
  <code>public</code>, etc.) should use the same indentation as the type name that they are declared
  under. They should not be indented in the same way as a field, method, or property.
  <br />
  <br />
  Please note:
  <br />
  - This rule checks for an exact match on trailing whitespace - mixed indentation may yield
  unexpected results.
