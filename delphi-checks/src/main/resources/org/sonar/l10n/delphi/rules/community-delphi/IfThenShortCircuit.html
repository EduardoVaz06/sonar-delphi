<p>
  While the IfThen function has similar use cases to the ternary operator found in other languages,
  there is one important distinction between them.
  <br />
  IfThen does not perform short-circuit evaluation. Both arguments are evaluated when the function
  is invoked.
  <br />
  <br />
  This rule will flag problematic usages of IfThen that could cause access violations.

<pre>
    
<b>var</b>
  Foo: TFoo;
<b>begin</b>
  Foo := <b>nil</b>;

  // Noncompliant: Access violation
  Result := IfThen(Assigned(Foo), Foo.Bar, 'Baz');

  // Compliant
  if Assigned(Foo) then begin
    Result := Foo.Bar;
  end
  else begin
    Result := 'Baz';
  end;
        
</pre>
