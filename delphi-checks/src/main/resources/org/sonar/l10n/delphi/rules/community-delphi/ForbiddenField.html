<p>
  This rule allows banning particular fields declared by a particular type. It will flag any direct
  reference to a field from the blacklist.
  <br />
  Please note:
  <br />
  - Blacklisted field names should be unqualified. (E.g. "FSomeField")
  <br />
  - The declaring type name should fully qualified. (E.g. "Unit.Type.InnerType")
</p>
