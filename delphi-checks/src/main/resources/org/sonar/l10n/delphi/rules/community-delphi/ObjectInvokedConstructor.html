<p>
  A common error for new Delphi programmers is to call a constructor using an object-type variable.
  Rather than creating the object, such a call invariably results in access violations because the
  object reference is most likely invalid.
  <br />
  <br />
  Even if this is intentional and the object reference is valid, the constructor is treated like a
  regular method invocation.
  <br />
  The constructor is called, but misleadingly a new object isn't instantiated.

<b>var</b>
  Foo: TFoo;
<b>begin</b>
  Foo.Create; // Noncompliant
  Foo := TFoo.Create; // Compliant
