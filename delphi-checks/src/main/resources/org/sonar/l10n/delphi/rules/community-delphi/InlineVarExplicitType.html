  Inline var declarations can omit the type and allow the compiler to infer it.
  <br />
  <br />
  There are a few downsides to using this feature:
  <br />
  - Lack of type information can make code harder to follow and understand at a glance.
  <br />
  - Type expansion that occurs during type inference can lead to unexpected inferred types.
  <br />
  - Wrapper types relying on implicit type conversions will not have those conversions invoked.
