<p>
  Programmers should not comment out code as it bloats programs and reduces readability.
  <br />
  <br />
  Unused code should be deleted and can be retrieved from source control history if required.
  <br />
  <br />
  NOTE: Please be mindful of the fact that certain comments, such as a single word followed by a
  semicolon, are indistinguishable from Delphi code and will be flagged.
