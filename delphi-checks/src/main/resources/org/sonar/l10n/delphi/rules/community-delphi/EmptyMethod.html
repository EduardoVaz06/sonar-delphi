  Reasons for a method not to have a method body:
  <br />
  - It is an unintentional omission, and should be fixed to prevent unexpected behavior.
  <br />
  - It is an override or virtual method with a nested comment explaining why the method is blank.
  <br />
  - It is an interface implementation method with a nested comment explaining why the method is
  blank.
