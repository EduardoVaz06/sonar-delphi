<p>
  A common error for new Delphi programmers is to call a constructor using an instance variable.
  Rather than creating the instance, such a call invariably results in access violations because the
  instance reference is most likely invalid.
  <br />
  <br />
  Even if this is intentional and the instance reference is valid, the constructor is treated like a
  regular method invocation.
  <br />
  The constructor is called, but misleadingly a new instance isn't created.

  Foo := TFoo.Create; // Compliant
