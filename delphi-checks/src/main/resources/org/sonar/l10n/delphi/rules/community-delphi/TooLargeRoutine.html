<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
  A routine that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities. Such routines
  inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain.
</p>
<p>
  Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller routines which focus
  on well-defined tasks. Those smaller routines will not only be easier to understand, but also
  easier to test.
</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Refactor the large routine into smaller routine, each focusing on a single well-defined task.</p>
