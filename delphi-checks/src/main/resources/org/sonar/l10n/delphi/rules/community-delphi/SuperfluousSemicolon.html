<p>
  Stray semicolons are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:
  <br />
  - It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten.
  <br />
  - There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e ;;.

<pre>
    
Result := 123; // Compliant

Result := 123;; // Noncompliant
        
</pre>
