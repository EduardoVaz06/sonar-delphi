<p>
  Casting a Character type to a Character Pointer type is non-portable between different versions of
  Delphi.
  <br />
  <br />
  In Delphi 10.4, there's a significant breaking change in the code generation around Char/AnsiChar
  -> PChar/PAnsiChar casts.
  <br />
  Rather than taking the ordinal value of the character and converting it to a pointer, a new
  single-character string is constructed and the pointer to that string is returned instead.
