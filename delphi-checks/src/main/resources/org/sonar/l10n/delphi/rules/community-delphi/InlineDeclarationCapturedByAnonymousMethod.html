<p>
  Up until Delphi 10.4.2, there are compiler bugs related to inline variables captured by anonymous
  methods.
  <br />
  <br />
  - Inline variables will not have their lifetimes extended until the anonymous method goes out of
  scope. (Fixed in 10.4.1)
  <br />
  - Inline variables with managed types will not have their reference count updated when the
  anonymous method goes out of scope, causing memory leaks. (Fixed in 10.4.2)
