<p>
  This rule allows banning certain constants. It will flag any direct reference to a constant from
  the blacklist.
  <br />
  <br />
  Please note:
  <br />
  - Blacklisted constant names should be unqualified. (E.g. "C_MyConstant")
  <br />
  - Only top-level constants in a specified unit are supported.
