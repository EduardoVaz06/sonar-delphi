<p>
  Unused global variables should be removed.
  <br />
  Leaving them in reduces the code's readability, since their presence can be confusing.
  <br />
  <br />
  <b>Exclusions:</b>
  <br />
  Form variables generated by the IDE are excluded from this rule.
  <br />
  The exclusion is based on the following heuristic:
  <br />
  - A variable declaration section is the last element in the interface section
  <br />
  - There is a single variable declaration in the variable declaration section.
  <br />
  - The variable declaration's type descends from <code>TComponent</code>
