<p>
  Unused and useless imports should be removed.
  <br />
  Leaving them in reduces the code's readability, since their presence can be confusing.
  <br />
  <br />
  WARNING: Take care when removing imports of units with a Register procedure or
  initialization/finalization section.
  <br />
  A unit must be imported at least once for code in these locations to be executed.
  <br />
  <br />
  Known false-positives:
  <br />
  - Imports that are only referenced in the DFM file.
